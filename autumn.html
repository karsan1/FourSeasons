<p>Autumn is one of the four temperate seasons</p>
<p>The fall planting months are Septmeber, October, and November</p>
<p>Dates range from Sepetember 21st through November 21st</p>
<p>October 2010 had five Mondays, five Fridays, and five Saturdays. This only happens once every 823 years. Oh and if you didn't know, October 31st is Halloween!</p>
<p>I'm sure you've heard people say, "lets go bobbing for apples." Well, the phrase "bobbing for apples," actually is of Roman origin</p>
<p>The biggest holiday that is associated with Autumn is.... Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is always on the fourth Thursday of November</p>
<h2>Why is this season called Fall? What happens in nature during this season?</h2>
<p>The leaves on many trees die and fall to the ground. About five hundered years ago, when Middle English was spoken, expressions like "fall of the leaf" and "fall of the year" were quite common, and the season name "Fall" comes from them.</p>
